# Data Entry System - Demo Mode

You can now run this project without the .NET Backend!

## How to use:
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (Double click the file).
2. Click **"Demo Admin"** or **"Demo User"**.
3. You will be logged in with the selected role using mock data.

## Features in Demo Mode:
- **Login Bypass**: No need for a real username/password.
- **Mock Data**: Revenues, Expenses, and Summaries are populated with sample data.
- **Form Submission**: You can add new records (they will appear successful but won't be saved permanently).
